# Database-Design-for-An-Oversea-Shopper-Company

# One Page Business Proposal   üìù

## Summary: 
Team Voltaire propose to improve offering and pricing, build sales and inventory tracking system management, increase customer satisfaction, revenue and profits by integrating all records of sales, vendors, products, customers and employees into a database and use structured query language  to communicate with database for supporting operations and  improving profit.


## Business Needs
1. Purchase prices are too high, making profits too low
2. On-line sales and pricing is arbitrary, preventing increase of revenues
3. No inventory managing, which increase costs and decrease profits
4. Net Present Value and retention rate of customers are not satisfactory 
5. Overseas shipping is slow and the cost is too high, decreasing customer satisfaction and making profits too low 

## Business Requirement
1. Merchandise purchases
2. Online sales and pricing
3. Inventory management
4. Customer-relationship management
5. Overseas shipping

 
 ## Business Values
1. More scientific good offering and pricing promote more sales, increasing revenue and profits.
2. By lowering purchase prices, Mo‚Äôs company can improve profits increase, further can offer lower sale price and increase revenue.
3. By analysis what categories or products are the best sellers, Mo‚Äôs company pre-order items that sell best and reduce the lean time which can promote customer experience and further increase revenue.
4. By creating a database to track & manage inventory, this will decrease cost and show analysis to improve areas where profits can be increased. Creating a database to track manage inventory has little cost associated there but will yield much future profit.  This database will also reduce inventory loss, increasing revenue.
5. By using domestic warehouse companies, this will decrease the overseas shipping, that reduces cost, ship faster, reaches the customer quicker, reducing the receiving time. This will increase customer satisfaction & loyalty, which will increase sales, thereby increasing inventory turnover, reducing warehouse costs, increasing overall profits.

 ##  Constraints
  1.  Only having incomplete records from last 8 months
  2.  Development and deployment costs must not exceed $2000
  3.  Must be implemented by July 4th.
